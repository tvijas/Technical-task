## Technical Task Implementation

The technical task was followed carefully. If something seems missing, it might not have been specified in the task or misunderstood. Additional features were added to improve functionality or simplify the project.

## Testing Approach

Tests are written at the controller level because of the controllerâ€™s input validation.

## Final Note

I hope the coding style and approach are to your liking. Please provide any feedback or request adjustments if needed.
